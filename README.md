# SharedSpace
A Xamarin Forms expandable list for iOS &amp; Android, providing a single group to be expanded at a time.    

The aim of this project is to create a cross-platform expandable list which enables data-binding within your view model. This was inspired by the work of [Jay Shukla](https://github.com/shuklajay/CollapseListView-in-xamarin.forms) and a big thank you goes to him.
